# HighLow-Game
Simple card game my flatmate and I came up when there was no wifi.

We played it two players, but I'm sure it can be expanded to have multiple.

How to play:
  1. Divide your cards equally amongst everyone.
  2. The highest card is a king
  4. First player puts their card down (if you can't decide, play by the "left of the dealer goes first" rule)
  5. Player next to them, in a clockwise fashion puts their card
  6. Continue this until it's the first player's turn again.
  7. Whoever throws the highest card wins and takes all the cards and places them at the bottom of the deck
  8. The winner goes first next round
  9. In the event of a draw, (the cards put down are the same), play another round and the person with the highest card takes all
     (i.e. keep playing rounds and follow the rules above)
     
The winner is the person who walks away with the whole deck, or most cards

I simulated the game in python, because the game went on forever, and it turns out, even after 100,000 rounds between two people, the game was still going on. So, I think this is a game that probably never ends, but has a constant cycle of how many cards a person has.
